## what is Java ?
- Java is high level programming language that was developed by James gosling in the year of 1982 . it is based on the principle of Object oriented Programing and develop large application

 ## Why is Java a platform independent language? 
 - Java language was developed  so that it doesn't depend on any hardware or software because the compiler compiles the code and it converts it into plateform indipendent byte code which can run on any multiple system
 - The only condition to run that byte code is for the machine to have a runtime environment (JRE) installed in it.

## what are primitive types of Java? 
- byte
- short
- int
- long
- boolean
- char
- float
- double

## Why Java is not pure OOPS language?
- Java is not not pure object oriented programming language because it supports primitive types like byte , char ,short , long , int , double , float , boolean 
- static methonds can directly access in main without using object

## How does java memory is stored ?
- Heap memory 
- Stack memory

## Stack Memory 
- Stack memory is the portion of memory which was assigned to every individual  program and it was fixed
- when we write a java pragram all the variables methods etc are stored in stack memory

## Heap Memory 
- Heap memory is the portion of memory with is not allocate of the program but it will be available for the use of  java program when it is required mostly on run time
- when we create any object in Java program then that object is created in heap memory

## what is Data Encapsulation ?
- Encapsulation is an Object oriented programing concept which is used to bundling the data attributes and  there behaviors into a single unit
- it is used to hide the data from unauthorized user

## what is abstaction ?
- Abstaction in java refers to hiding the implemention details of code and exposing only the necessary information to end user

## What is Polymorphism ?
- Polymorphism is  the task that  perform single action in different ways . the word poly means many morphism means forms
- there are two types of polymorphism
- method overloading (Compile time polymorphism)
- method overriding (Run time polymorphism)

## What is overloading 
- when there are multiple functions with same name and different parameters are know as method overloading (Compile time polymorphism)

## What is method overriding 
- if the child class has the same method as declared in parent class it is know as method overriding (Run time polymorphism)

## what is inheritance 
- inheritance is important concept of OOPS . inheritance allows a class to inherit the feature (fields and methods ) from another class
- it helps in code reuseablity (the child class can use parent class method and fields )
- without inheritance we wont be able to do method overriding

## what is interface in java 
- in Java , interface specify the behaviour of the class by providing abstact type

## What is Class in java
- A class is a set of objects which shares common characteristics / behavior and common properties .

## What is Objects in Java 
- an object is a member of java class its also known as instence of the class .
  
## final, finally and finalize keywords have the same function? 
- Final keyword is used to restrict the overriding method
- Finally is block used to in try , catch . it is used to handle exceptions
- finalize is method is called so that the clean-up activity is implemented

## How would you differentiate between a String, StringBuffer, and a StringBuilder ?
- storeage area : in string , String pool serves as the storeage area . in String buffer and String Builder it is stored in heaps
- mutability : String is immutable . where as String buffer and string builder are mutable
- Efficiency : working with string is slow , string builder is fastest in programing operations , String buffer is faster than string and slow than string builder
